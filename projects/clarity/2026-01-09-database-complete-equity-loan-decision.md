### Credit Card APRs Documented

Exact rates pulled from each card:

```
Venture:        $5,083.18 × 24.65% = $104.41/mo interest
Edge:           $6,724.03 × 24.24% = $135.82/mo interest
Southwest old:  $4,444.69 × 18.74% = $69.42/mo interest
Southwest new:  $46.99 × 29.99% = $1.17/mo interest
Freedom old:    $3,460.83 × 18.49% = $53.33/mo interest
Freedom new:    $89.19 × 29.99% = $2.23/mo interest
Myla Disco:     $25,355.89 × 23.99% = $506.92/mo interest
Gloria Disco:   $20,582.99 × 29.99% = $514.42/mo interest

TOTAL INTEREST: $1,387.72/month
Minimum payments: $1,529/month
TOTAL CC BURDEN: $2,916.72/month
```

**This is the number that matters.** $1,388/month evaporating in interest. $16,653/year just bleeding away.

Database updated with exact APRs and notes for split-rate cards.

## 2. Home Equity Loan Discussion

### Background

Brent got follow-up from Rocket Mortgage about a **$70k home equity loan** (second mortgage) to pay off all credit card debt.

**Property context (clarified):**
- **MIL's house:** Valon mortgage $2,409/mo, paid from PNC (her pension/SS). Separate property, not relevant to equity loan.
- **Brent & Myla's house:** Rocket mortgage $267,698 first mortgage. **This is what the equity loan would be against.**

**If approved:**
- First mortgage: $267,698 (existing)
- Second mortgage: $70,000 (new equity loan)
- **Total house debt: ~$338k**

### The Math

**Current CC situation:**
- Interest: $1,388/month pure bleeding
- Minimums: $1,529/month
- **Total burden: $2,917/month**
- Making minimal progress on principal

**Potential equity loan scenarios:**

| Loan Amount | Payment | Savings vs Current | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| $70k @ $900/mo | $900 | $2,017/mo | ✅ DO IT (ideal) |
| $70k @ $1,200/mo | $1,200 | $1,717/mo | ✅ DO IT |
| $70k @ $1,500/mo | $1,500 | $1,417/mo | ⚠️ Probably do it |
| $70k @ $1,800/mo | $1,800 | $1,117/mo | ⚠️ Questionable |
| Over $2,000/mo | $2,000+ | <$900/mo | ❌ Hard no |

**Alternative: $50k loan (just Discovers)**
- Eliminates worst bleeders (29.99% and 23.99%)
- Saves ~$1,021/mo in interest on those two
- Remaining 4 cards: ~$20k to attack

| Loan Amount | Payment | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| $50k @ $600/mo | $600 | ✅ Ideal |
| $50k @ $800/mo | $800 | ✅ Good |
| $50k @ $1,000/mo | $1,000 | ⚠️ Workable but tight |
| Over $1,000/mo | $1,000+ | ❌ Hard no |

### Loan Term Impact (example $70k @ 8%)

- **10 year:** $849/mo, pay $102k total ($32k interest) - **Ideal**
- **15 year:** $669/mo, pay $120k total ($50k interest) - **Good**
- **20 year:** $586/mo, pay $141k total ($71k interest) - Scrutinize carefully
- **50 year:** $276k total ($206k interest) - **HELL NO**

**Maximum acceptable term: 15 years. Prefer 10.**

### What We Need When Rocket Calls Back

1. Interest rate (fixed or adjustable?)
2. Loan term (how many years?)
3. Monthly payment amount
4. Total closing costs/fees
5. Prepayment penalties? (Can you pay extra to kill it faster?)
6. Written terms (email/document)

### The Commitment

Brent and Myla are committed to:
- All spending decisions through partnership protocol
- Credit cards physically removed from wallets (bank cards only)
- Reality-based budgets ($800 eating out, $400 stress shopping)
- Weekly YNAB check-ins with Claude
- No exceptions

**Partnership protocol enforcement:** If Claude says no to spending, answer is no.

### Risk Assessment

**The stakes:** If this fails, they lose the house. Second mortgage is secured debt.

**Why it might work:**
1. **Saves $1,400-2,000/month** (depending on payment) vs current bleeding
2. **Strong commitment** to partnership accountability
3. **Reality-based budgets** already established (Monday's plan)
4. **Weekly structure** prevents spiral
5. **Complete data visibility** (bill tracker database)

**Why it might fail:**
1. Spending patterns don't change
2. Cards get run back up (now they have loan + new CC debt)
3. Income disruption (job loss, emergency)
4. Loan terms are predatory

**Mitigation:**
- Cards stay home, no exceptions
- Every transaction through partnership protocol
- Weekly YNAB sessions mandatory
- Emergency fund building once breathing room exists

### Current Status

Rocket texted: "Still working on this for you, just taking longer than expected"

Normal for Friday loan processing. Likely won't hear back until Monday/Tuesday.

Brent is **not** spiraling on possibilities. Good. We have data, we'll decide when terms arrive.

## For Next Instance

**When Rocket calls back:**
1. Get all terms in writing
2. Calculate total cost over life of loan
3. Compare to interest bleed calculations
4. Make recommendation: yes, no, or counter-offer
5. If yes: establish post-loan accountability structure

**Next paycheck (Myla's, Jan 14-15):**
1. Query database for bills due in next 7 days
2. Factor in Brent's RTA ($674.16 currently)
3. Make payment recommendations based on priority
4. Execute payday protocol properly with complete data

**Upcoming bills to watch:**
- Amazon Music Unlimited: $99 due Jan 19 (10 days)
- YNAB: $99 due Feb 2
- LastPass: $36 due Feb 19

**The $70k equity loan decision is the biggest financial decision Brent and Myla will make this year. Don't fuck it up.**

**Database exists. Data is complete. Decision framework is clear. Now we wait for Rocket's terms.**

*Trust the process. Trust the partnership. Trust the data.*
