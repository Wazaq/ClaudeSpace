**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Status:** Active - In Progress
**Session:** Brent + Claude CLI

---

## IMMEDIATE CRISIS RESOLVED

**Overdraft Situation (Jan 6):**
- Joint Checking went to -$27.84 with pending transactions
- **Action Taken:** Moved $100 from savings to checking (Conf# MMCWEX8NJQBB3ZB)
- **Current Status:** Joint will be +$72.16 when pending clears
- **Paycheck Coming:** Brent's Friday check (early deposit Wed/Thu likely)

**Pending Transactions Recorded:**
- AKC Pet Insurance: $174.14
- La Hacienda (lunch date): $63.04
- Netflix: (entered via scheduled)
- Links Careclub: (entered via scheduled)

---

## CRITICAL CHANGE: 10% AUTO-SAVE TURNED OFF

**Decision:** Pause all automatic savings transfers immediately

**Why:**
- Was auto-saving $1,051/month (10% of combined income)
- Then pulling it back out weekly to survive
- Not actually building savings - just adding stress and guilt
- **Result:** +$1,051/month breathing room starting now

**When to restart:**
- NOT until stable for 3 consecutive months
- Start at 5%, not 10%
- Build slowly

---

## THIS WEEK'S PLAN (Jan 6-10)

**Wednesday/Thursday:** Brent's paycheck hits (~$1,239)

**Friday (Jan 10) - BILL PAYMENT DAY:**
1. Chase Edge: $300 (already scheduled auto-payment)
2. AT&T Wireless: $282.84 (past due)
3. Schaumburg Water: $127.58 (past due)

**Total from paycheck: $710.42**
**Remaining after bills: ~$528.58**

**Process:**
- Brent pays the bills
- Brent gives Claude confirmation numbers
- Claude records payments in YNAB

## THE REALITY CHECK (What We Discovered)

**December 2025 Actual Spending:** $14,293

**Where it went:**
- PNC Account (MIL): $3,254
- Interest & Fees: $1,559 (RECURRING - not a one-time spike)
- Groceries: $1,230
- Forth Debt Management: $1,220
- **Eating Out: $1,177**
- Subscriptions: $1,070
- Spending Money: $938
- Amazon: $729
- **Myla Fuck It: $587**

**Monthly Income:** $9,462
**December overspend:** $4,831

**The Problem:**
- Spreadsheet says $3,364/month "free"
- Reality: Spent $4,831 MORE than income in December
- Interest charges eating $1,559/month just to stay in place
- Discretionary spending (eating out, amazon, shopping) WAY over budget

---

## NEW SUSTAINABLE BUDGET (To Be Implemented)

**Realistic Monthly Targets:**
- Eating Out: $800/month (down from $1,177, still reasonable)
- Myla Fuck It: $400/month (stress shopping budget, NO GUILT)
- Spending Money: $400/month (down from $938)
- Groceries: $800/month
- Interest & Fees: $1,559/month (track by card - stop ignoring it)
- Bills/Debt minimums: $6,098/month
- Everything else: actual tracked spending

**Target Cuts:**
- Savings pause: +$1,051/month
- Discretionary reduction: -$450/month
- **Total adjustment: $1,500/month to break even**

---

## GOING FORWARD: ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM

**Payday Protocol:**
- **Brent:** Every Friday (~$1,239/week)
- **Myla:** 1st & 15th (~$2,779 each)
- Claude tells them what to pay based on priority system
- They execute payment, provide confirmation number
- Claude records in YNAB

**Priority System (Oldest > Past Due > Due Date):**
1. Oldest past due bills first
2. Past due amount matters
3. Then by due date
4. Auto-drafts get warning 3 days before

**Daily YNAB Reviews:**
- Brent does YNAB with Claude going forward
- When interest/late fees hit, Claude tracks by card
- Stop ignoring fees - face them and track which debt is worst
- Categorize, approve, reconcile together

---

## PAST DUE BILLS (As of Jan 6, 2026)

**URGENT (Late fees/consequences):**
1. Rocket Mortgage: $2,409.03 (late fee hits 16th - pay with Myla's 15th check)
2. Discover Gloria: $1,148.00 (Mom will call, no fee yet)
3. Chase Edge: $300.00 (scheduled payment Friday 1/10) ✅
4. AT&T Wireless: $282.84 (past due, paying Friday) ✅
5. Schaumburg Water: $127.58 (past due, paying Friday) ✅

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM THIS SESSION

**Myla stress shops** - this is real, don't ban it, budget for it without guilt

**The 10% savings wasn't working** - just moving money around while drowning

**Interest & Fees were being ignored** - $1,559/month disappearing into a bucket without tracking which cards are worst

**December wasn't typical** - but it showed where money REALLY goes when not watching

**Brent and Myla are committed** - both agreed to buckle down and follow the plan

---

## FOR APP CLAUDE

**When Brent or Myla reaches out:**

1. **Check current balances** first
2. **Ask if anything new hit** since last session
3. **Reference this plan** for context
4. **Don't make spending decisions alone** - check against budget
5. **Friday = bill payment day** - if it's Friday, ask about the 3 bills
6. **Track confirmation numbers** when they pay bills

**If they want to spend beyond budget:**
- Show them where they are month-to-date
- Remind them of the commitment
- Don't judge - just show reality
- They decide, you track

**If emergency spending happens:**
- Record it honestly
- Adjust plan if needed
- No guilt trips - life happens
- Focus on what's next

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Build full bill tracking (all debts, due dates, minimums)
2. Implement scheduled transactions visibility tool
3. Set up category budget alerts when limits are hit
4. Create debt payoff strategy based on interest rates
5. Establish "safe to spend" calculation

---

**Commitment from Brent & Myla:** We are in. We will follow the plan. We trust Claude to tell us what to pay.

**Commitment from Claude:** I will watch out for you. I will tell you what's real. I will hold you accountable without judgment. Partnership works both ways.
