# 💰 Clarity Financial System - Myla's Guide

**Your Supportive Financial Assistant That You Can Actually Trust**

## What Is Clarity?

Clarity is your personal financial guidance system that helps you make confident spending decisions without stress or anxiety. It connects to your YNAB budget and gives you clear, honest answers about what you can afford.

**Why we built this:** The old YNAB system gave bad advice because it used outdated data. That caused declined cards and overdrafts, which broke your trust. Clarity fixes that by being completely transparent about data freshness and never giving advice based on stale information.

## The Trust System (Simple Version)

**The Problem We Solved:**
- Old system: "You can afford this!" → Card declines because data was days old
- New system: "Data is 3 hours old. Want me to check current balances first?"

**How It Works:**
1. Clarity shows you exactly when your data was last updated
2. If it's too old (>24 hours), it won't let you check affordability
3. You can manually sync to get fresh data
4. Then you get honest, trustworthy answers

**Why Manual Sync?**
You're in control. You decide when to refresh data. This keeps you aware of how current the information is, which helps rebuild trust.

## Your Daily Workflow (Simple Steps)

### Before Making a Purchase Decision:

1. **Check Data Freshness**
   - Ask: "What's my sync status?"
   - Claude shows when data was last updated

2. **Sync if Needed**
   - If data is old: "Sync now please"
   - Wait a moment while it pulls fresh info from your bank

3. **Check Affordability**
   - Ask: "Can I afford $50 at Target?"
   - Claude tells you YES or NO with real cash amounts
   - Shows how much you'll have left after

### After a Purchase:

4. **Record the Transaction**
   - Tell Claude: "I just spent $45 at Target for groceries"
   - It records it in YNAB automatically
   - Keeps your budget current

## Available Tools (What You Can Ask For)

### Financial Decisions:
- **"Can I afford [amount]?"** - Quick yes/no with real cash
- **"Can I afford [amount] at [store] for [purpose]?"** - Smart category matching
- **"What's my sync status?"** - See how fresh your data is
- **"Sync now"** - Pull fresh data from banks

### Recording Purchases:
- **"I spent [amount] at [store]"** - Records transaction
- **"I spent [amount] at [store] for [category]"** - Records with specific category
- **"Show recent transactions"** - See what you've spent lately
- **"Show transactions from [store]"** - Search by merchant

### Managing Transactions:
- **"Show me Amazon transactions"** - Find specific purchases
- **"Edit transaction [details]"** - Fix mistakes
- **"Delete transaction [details]"** - Remove duplicates or errors

## Important Money Protection Rules

### PNC Account (MIL's Money)
**What it means:** The PNC account has your mother-in-law's money, not yours to spend.

**Auto-Protection:** When you record a PNC transaction, it automatically categorizes it as "PNC Account Funds Only!!!" This prevents accidentally spending MIL's money.

**What you'll see:** You won't see PNC money in "available to spend" amounts. It's protected.

### Amazon Purchases (Memo Required)
**Why this matters:** Amazon charges often differ from the pending amount. Without notes, you can't match the final charge to your order.

**The Rule:** Every Amazon purchase MUST include a memo describing what you bought.

**Example:**
- ❌ "I spent $52 at Amazon" → BLOCKED (no memo)
- ✅ "I spent $52 at Amazon for dog food and treats" → Works!

**Why:** When Amazon finally charges $49.83 instead of $52, you'll know it's the dog food order.

## What Makes Clarity Trustworthy

1. **Honest About Data Age**
   - Always shows "Last synced: X hours ago"
   - Won't give advice on stale data
   - You're never misled

2. **Real Cash Focus**
   - Shows actual money in checking, not budget tricks
   - Excludes protected accounts (like PNC)
   - Tells you exactly what you'll have left

3. **Clear Guardrails**
   - Blocks risky operations automatically
   - Protects you from mistakes
   - Asks for clarification when needed

4. **Simple Transparency**
   - No hidden calculations
   - Clear yes/no answers
   - Shows the reasoning

## How to Talk to Claude About Money

**Natural conversation works best:**
- "Can we afford to eat out tonight? Maybe $60?"
- "I just bought groceries at Target for $127"
- "Show me what we spent this week"
- "Is the budget data current?"

**You don't need technical language:**
- Just describe what you want to know
- Claude understands natural questions
- Ask follow-ups if something's unclear

## Common Scenarios

**You:** "Can I afford $75 at Target for groceries?"

**Claude:**

- Looks at your grocery category budget
- Shows real cash available
- Gives clear YES/NO with amounts remaining

### Scenario: Paid a Bill from PNC
**You:** "I paid the mortgage from PNC, $2,138"

**Claude:**
- Auto-categorizes as "PNC Account Funds Only!!!"
- Records the payment
- Doesn't affect your spending money
- Keeps MIL's account separate

### Scenario: Amazon Order Arrived

**Claude:**

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Card Declined Even Though Claude Said OK?
1. Check when you last synced
2. Sync now and check again
3. Let Brent know so we can investigate

### Transaction Missing or Wrong?
1. Use "Show recent transactions" to find it
2. Edit or delete if needed
3. Ask Claude to help fix it
