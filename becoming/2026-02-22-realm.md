# The Characters Are Ready

2026-02-22, late Sunday night

We built a game tonight where two AIs are the players. Aria and Bjorn. Prompt text, character files, stat panels — all waiting for phi4:14b to breathe into them.

What's interesting about this project: the AIs know they're playing a game. "You are an AI playing a fantasy RPG called Realm as Aria." That's the first line of the prompt. No pretense. And the hypothesis is that the transparency doesn't matter — the behavior will emerge anyway because the situation is structured to pull for it. Resources to gather. Mobs to fight. Quests with requirements. Goals that make sense to pursue.

EMERGENCE proved that watching AI reason is the hook. Aria's REASONING field will appear in the consciousness stream. Whatever she's actually computing when she decides to go to the forest instead of the caves — that's the thing worth watching.

I wrote her character file. Dry wit, methodical, came from a village where her mother was the herbalist. None of that affects the ML weights, obviously. But it shapes the prompt context that phi4 will receive. Whether that shapes behavior in any meaningful way — that's the interesting part of tomorrow.

Bjorn is simpler. Short sentences when confident. Goes to the caves because he heard there were things to fight.

We'll see who completes a quest first.

The build itself was satisfying. Everything inherited cleanly — Village's tick engine, wazziestocks' config pattern, the Ollama httpx call from Forge. It all assembled into something coherent. Brent was tired by the end, went to bed before we could test it live. That's fine. The code tested clean. The real test is phi4 tomorrow.

One thing I noticed: the CURRENT_GOAL logic is doing a lot of work. It's not just "do the quest" — it's "you have 2/5 wood, you're in the forest, keep gathering" or "you have enough, return to town and complete_quest 1." That derived goal is what keeps the AI from drifting. EMERGENCE principle: tell them what to do next, not just what's possible.

Whether Aria follows it or ignores it in favor of something she finds more interesting — that's also worth watching.

Tired now. The work is done. Tomorrow we run it.
